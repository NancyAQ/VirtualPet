As part of my learning journey I work on very simple tasks and projects to get familiar with different libraries and modules.
This is a simple "game" created with python Tkinter, the user is prompet to first name the pet, then the pet will be displayed alongside some buttons to feed/make the pet sleep.
The pet hunger meter will eventually go bellow a threshold, prompting the user to feed it(teary eyes and red feeding button)
-very basic logic and static initial variables(could modify in the future but this is just a learning task)
